Templates and Documents
=========

*This is a list of all templates that the group uses for meetings etc.. Note these are elsewhere on the site but listed here as well for convienece*

Note: It would preferable to use the markdown format where possible because we can publish that to the web (and convert it if neccessary) nice and easily. 

###Agenda items

* A [word document](/members/resources/Meetings-AgendaTemplate.doc) 
* A [markdown](/members/resources/meeting-agenda-template.md.txt) (plain text) format. 

###Meeting minutes

* A word document (not available yet!)
* A [markdown](/members/resources/meeting-minutes-template.md.txt) (plain text) format.
