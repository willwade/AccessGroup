We have a number of templates to help the running of the group go smoothly. Find these below. 

###Agenda items

* A [word document](/members/resources/Meetings-AgendaTemplate.doc) 
* A [markdown](/members/resources/meeting-agenda-template.md.txt) (plain text) format. 

Note: It would preferable to use the markdown format because we can publish that nice and easily.

* A [markdown](/members/resources/meeting-minutes-template.md.txt) (plain text) format.
