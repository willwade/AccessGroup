About this site
===============

*(and how to edit documents for it!)*
  
This site is built using [mdwiki](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!index.md). Feel free to read more about it there but in essence each page you visit is just a text file writen in something called [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Markdown is readable by anything - it makes publishing documents to the web far easier than if they were in word documents or even PDF. Take a look at how the documents are styled and have a play with formatting them yourself [here](http://markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).

If you would like to edit the documents on the site - you can. Please get in touch with [Will](http://willwa.de) and he will share the dropbox folder which is the entire site. By using dropbox we can create versions of documents, roll-back on different documents and create a backup solution.
