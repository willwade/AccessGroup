Meetings
-------------

We try and hold two day long meetings per year to enable members to meet up, discuss cases and share knowledge. 

The next meeting is on the 14th December at [ACT Birmingham](http://www.bhamcommunity.nhs.uk/about-us/clinical-services/specialist-services/rehabilitation/services/act/). Time: 10-4. Please let us know if you can make it [here](http://bit.ly/ataspring2015).  Agenda to be confirmed.. (Watch this space!)

A list of the previous meetings - and the [minutes from these can be found in the members area](members/meetings.md).
